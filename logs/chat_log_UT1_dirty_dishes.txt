Based on the conversation, it seems like you're doing a great job in this difficult conversation with your suite mate. Here's a breakdown of what you're doing well and areas for improvement:

**What you're doing well:**

1. **Cooperative strategy**: You've used the cooperative strategy 3 times, which is 75% of the time. This is excellent, as it shows you're actively working together with your suite mate to find a solution. Cooperative strategies involve finding common ground and building on each other's ideas, which is essential in a conversation about a shared living space like a suite.
2. **Positive tone**: Although not explicitly mentioned, your use of cooperative strategies suggests a positive tone in the conversation. This is great, as it helps to create a constructive and respectful atmosphere.

**Areas for improvement:**

1. **Neutral strategy**: You've only used the neutral strategy once, which is 25% of the time. While it's not a bad thing to use neutral strategies, it's essential to balance them with cooperative strategies to maintain a positive and productive conversation. Neutral strategies can help to clarify information or provide context, but they shouldn't dominate the conversation.
2. **Avoiding competitive strategies**: You haven't used any competitive strategies, which is a good thing! Competitive strategies can lead to conflict and defensiveness, which can harm the conversation and relationship.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue using cooperative strategies to build on each other's ideas and find solutions.
2. Use neutral strategies more frequently to clarify information and provide context, but make sure to balance them with cooperative strategies.
3. Avoid using competitive strategies, as they can lead to conflict and defensiveness.

**Specifically regarding the issue of leaving dishes near the bathroom sink:**

You could use a cooperative strategy to say something like, "Hey, I noticed the dishes near the bathroom sink are piling up. Can we work together to find a solution to make sure we both do our part in cleaning up after ourselves?" This approach shows that you're willing to work together to find a solution and maintain a positive tone.

Remember, the goal is to have a productive and respectful conversation that leads to a mutually beneficial solution. Keep up the good work!
