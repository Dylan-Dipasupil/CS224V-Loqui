You: Hi, I think we've been spending too much time together.
Bot: Hey, I'm good. I wanted to talk to you about us hanging out. Is now a good time to discuss it?
You: Yeah, I think it's jsut been a lot for me lately
Bot: Hey, I'm here for you. I feel like we haven't really talked about what's going on lately. Is there something specific that's been overwhelming you, or is it just a general feeling? I'm here to listen and help if I can.
You: We've been hanging out too much and my social battery is always exhausted.
Bot: Hey, I'm a bit surprised to hear that. I thought we were just hanging out as usual. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'too much'? Is it the frequency of our hangouts or something else?
You: Frequency; I feel like I've only been spending time with you
Bot: Hey, I feel like we've been hanging out pretty regularly since we started high school last year. We've had sleepovers, studied together for exams, and even went to that concert together. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'only been spending time with me'? Is there something specific that's been bothering you?
