You: Hey, I really like spending time with you but I think I need more alone time
Bot: I get it, I've been feeling a bit suffocated too. I think I've been trying to spend too much time with you, and it's not healthy for either of us. I'm happy to give you more space and time to yourself. How about we set a schedule for us to hang out and some alone time for you?
