----------------------------------------
You: I feel like we spend too much time together
Bot: Hey, can we talk about this in person? I feel like we've been spending a lot of time together lately and I want to make sure we're both on the same page.
You: Let's talk now. I need more alone time to reset.
Bot: I get it, we've been together for 5 months now and I know we've been pretty inseparable. I've been feeling a bit suffocated too, to be honest. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "more alone time"? Is it just a few hours a day or a whole day or two?
You: I think an evening or two every week would be nice
Bot: That sounds doable. We've had some busy weeks lately, but I think we can make that work. I remember when we first started dating, we'd often have our own separate nights to recharge. Do you think that's what you're looking for, or is it something more consistent?
You: Yes, but does that work for you?
Bot: Honestly, it's a bit of a compromise for me, but I think it's worth it if it makes you happy. I value our time together, but I also value our individual space. Can we try it out and see how it goes?
You: Sounds great
Bot: I'm glad we could talk about this. I think it'll be good for both of us to have some space to breathe. Let's make a plan to schedule our alone time in advance, so we can both look forward to it.
