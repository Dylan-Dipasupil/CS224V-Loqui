Based on the strategies you've been using to talk to your 14-year-old brother about his failing grades, here's a constructive feedback on what you've been doing well and what you can improve on:

**What you've been doing well:**

1. **Cooperative approach**: You've used the cooperative strategy 8 times, which is a great start. This approach involves working together with your brother to find solutions and understanding his perspective. This has likely helped him feel more comfortable and open to discussing his struggles.
2. **Positive Expectations**: Although not explicitly mentioned, your cooperative approach likely involves setting positive expectations, which is a great way to encourage your brother to do better. By focusing on what he can do well and what he's capable of, you're helping him build confidence and motivation.

**Areas for improvement:**

1. **Balancing Cooperative and Neutral strategies**: While your cooperative approach is great, it's essential to balance it with neutral strategies to avoid being too pushy or confrontational. Neutral strategies, like Facts and Procedural, can help you discuss the situation objectively and provide more information without being too confrontational.
2. **Using Concession and Rights strategies**: You haven't used the Concession and Rights strategies at all. These strategies can help you acknowledge your brother's feelings and perspectives while also setting boundaries and expectations. For example, you could say, "I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed, but I still expect you to meet your academic goals."
3. **Avoiding Power and Competitive strategies**: You haven't used Power or Competitive strategies, which is great. These strategies can come across as confrontational and may lead to defensiveness. Stick to cooperative and neutral strategies to maintain a positive and productive conversation.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue using the cooperative approach, but balance it with neutral strategies like Facts and Procedural to provide more information and context.
2. Introduce Concession and Rights strategies to acknowledge your brother's feelings and set clear expectations.
3. Avoid using Power and Competitive strategies, as they may lead to defensiveness and hurt feelings.

By making these adjustments, you can have a more productive and supportive conversation with your brother, helping him feel more comfortable and motivated to improve his grades.
